# Crowdfunding_In_Europe_Indiegogo

The notebook is related to my master's thesis to study the main factors that can impact the probability of a successful crowdfunding campaign in Europe based on the Indiegogo data platform.

## Objectives
This study aims to use the data scrapped from the Indiegogo website for crowdfunding in the European region in the period from 2010 to 2023 in order to:
- Predict the success or failure of the projects advertised on the platform based on the characteristics of the project using machine learning techniques. 
- Figure out the importance of the characteristics of the project campaign (e.g., number of backers) in defining the campaign's success.
- Explore the most successful project category types and the countries with the highest success rates by utilizing exploratory data analysis.

## Deployment
The champion model chosen was Logistic Regression, which is used to build a model using Flask to predict the campaign success based on certain criteria as shown below.
